<b><i>Simple Linear Regression using Python</i></b>

<b>Simple steps followed :</b>
1. Understanding the math behind Simple Linear Regression and need of this concept
2. Import required Libraries
3. Get the Data set
4. If needed, perform pre-processing task
5. Identify and define Dependent and Independent variables
6. Split the data (train data, test data)
7. Fit the model for train data
8. Predict for test data using the model
9. Visualization

<b><i>Logistic Regression using Python</i></b>

* To be precise linear regression is actually the underlying concept that is used in Logistic regression
* Understanding why Logistic regression is called as classifier 

<b>Simple steps followed :</b>
1. Understanding the math behind Logistic Regression and need of this concept. It is obvious logistic Regression is a classifier.
   Most preferrable when we perform Binary Classification
2. Import required Libraries
3. Get the Data set
4. If needed, perform pre-processing task
5. Identify and define target and Independent variables
6. Split the data (train data, test data)
7. Fit the model for train data
8. Predict for test data using the model
9. Visualization for train data and for test data as well so that it is easy to see which are classified correctly by our model
   In my code I used meshgrid to visualize the classification. Please Google for meshgrid.
