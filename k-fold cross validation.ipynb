    "A Gentle Introduction to k-fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used in applied machine learning to compare and select a model for a given predictive modeling problem because it is easy to understand, easy to implement, and results in skill estimates that generally have a lower bias than other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "That k-fold cross validation is a procedure used to estimate the skill of the model on new data.\n",
    "There are common tactics that you can use to select the value of k for your dataset.\n",
    "There are commonly used variations on cross-validation such as stratified and repeated that are available in scikit-learn.\n",
    "Letâ€™s get started.\n",

    "k-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation. When a specific value for k is chosen, it may be used in place of k in the reference to the model, such as k=10 becoming 10-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a popular method because it is simple to understand and because it generally results in a less biased or less optimistic estimate of the model skill than other methods, such as a simple train/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Shuffle the dataset randomly.\n",
    "Split the dataset into k groups\n",
    "For each unique group:\n",
    "Take the group as a hold out or test data set\n",
    "Take the remaining groups as a training data set\n",
    "Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set\n",
    "Retain the evaluation score and discard the model\n",
    "Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores"
